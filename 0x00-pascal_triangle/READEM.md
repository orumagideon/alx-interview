Pascal's Triangle Implementation in Python
This project focuses on implementing Pascal's Triangle in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept where each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it, forming a triangular array of numbers. The main goal is to create a function pascal_triangle(n) that generates Pascal's triangle of size n and returns it as a list of lists of integers.

Concepts Revised:
The implementation of Pascal's Triangle in Python involves revisiting various fundamental programming concepts, including:

Lists and List Comprehensions
Functions
Loops
Conditional Statements
Recursion (Optional)
Arithmetic Operations
Indexing and Slicing
Memory Management
Error and Exception Handling (Optional)
Efficiency and Optimization
By addressing these concepts, we aim to develop an efficient and effective solution for generating Pascal's Triangle.

Task 0: Pascal's Triangle
The primary task involves creating a function pascal_triangle(n) that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascalâ€™s triangle of size n. The function should handle edge cases such as n <= 0 by returning an empty list. The provided 0-main.py script demonstrates the usage of this function.

How to Use:
To use the pascal_triangle function, follow these steps:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
Run the 0-main.py script using the command python3 0-main.py.
The script will output Pascal's Triangle of size n, where n is specified in the script.
Example:
css
Copy code
$ python3 0-main.py
[1]
[1,1]
[1,2,1]
[1,3,3,1]
[1,4,6,4,1]
